# Feedback - Mongoose, express, Node, MongoDB, EJS

This application is a reverse engineering project to mimick the functionality of the 'Facebook'
comments feature, but serves more as a blog site where users can post writing prompts to a feed seen by all authorized users, who can then select and comment their thoughts on those posts. The posts are populated by pre-pending to the main feed by most recent date, and the same applies to the comments on each post. 

It uses a number of npm dependencies and security features, such as user authentication with salting and hashing of passwords, as is restfully routed with full CRUD functionality for posts.
