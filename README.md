# Feedback - Mongoose, express, Node, MongoDB, EJS

This application is a reverse engineering project to mimick the functionality of the 'Facebook'
comments feature, but serves more as a blog site where users can post writing prompts to a feed seen by all authorized users, who can then select and comment their thoughts on those posts. The posts are populated by pre-pending to the main feed by most recent date, and the same applies to the comments on each post. 

It uses a number of npm dependencies and security features, such as user authentication with salting and hashing of passwords, as is restfully routed with full CRUD functionality for posts. 

This was a challenging project and a great learning experience in how to access and use numerous utilities with Node and Express, and a first in working with a Non-SQL database (local storage). This project will be deployed on Heroku during the next update. Thanks for checking!
